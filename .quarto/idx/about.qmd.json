The goal is to analyze trends in confirmed cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and government responses across different states and regions. By leveraging custom functions and a structured data pipeline, this project provides insights into the pandemic's progression and its impact on various demographic and economic factors.\n\n### Key Objectives\n\n1.  **Data Preparation**: Standardize and clean COVID-19 datasets for analysis.\n2.  **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualize trends in infections, deaths, and vaccinations over time.\n3.  **Advanced Insights**: Investigate relationships between state wealth, population, and pandemic outcomes.\n4.  **Government Response**: Evaluate the effectiveness of government policies in mitigating the pandemic.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Tools and Technologies\n\nThis project is built using the following tools and libraries: - **R** for data analysis and visualization. - **Tidyverse** for data manipulation and cleaning. - **Quarto** for project documentation and reporting. - **Custom Functions** created for automating repetitive tasks and ensuring consistency in analysis.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe project is divided into three main sections, each documented in detail:\n\n### 1. Custom Functions\n\nThis section documents the custom functions developed for data preparation, analysis, and visualization. These functions are designed to handle tasks such as: - Standardizing state names across datasets. - Analyzing missing values and time spans. - Generating visualizations for confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination trends.\n\n[View Custom Functions Documentation](funcs.qmd)\n\n### 2. Data Cleaning\n\nThis section outlines the data cleaning pipeline, including: - Ingestion and standardization of COVID-19 datasets. - Handling missing values and inconsistencies. - Merging datasets to create a unified analysis-ready dataset.\n\n[View Data Cleaning Documentation](data-cleaning.qmd)\n\n### 3.
