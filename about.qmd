-   [EDA Process](eda.qmd)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on COVID-19 data in the United States. The goal is to analyze trends in confirmed cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and government responses across different states and regions. By leveraging custom functions and a structured data pipeline, this project provides insights into the pandemic's progression and its impact on various demographic and economic factors.

### Key Objectives

1.  **Data Preparation**: Standardize and clean COVID-19 datasets for analysis.
2.  **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualize trends in infections, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
3.  **Advanced Insights**: Investigate relationships between state wealth, population, and pandemic outcomes.
4.  **Government Response**: Evaluate the effectiveness of government policies in mitigating the pandemic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tools and Technologies

This project is built using the following tools and libraries: - **R** for data analysis and visualization. - **Tidyverse** for data manipulation and cleaning. - **Quarto** for project documentation and reporting. - **Custom Functions** created for automating repetitive tasks and ensuring consistency in analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main sections, each documented in detail:

### 1. Custom Functions

This section documents the custom functions developed for data preparation, analysis, and visualization. These functions are designed to handle tasks such as: - Standardizing state names across datasets. - Analyzing missing values and time spans. - Generating visualizations for confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination trends.

### 2. Data Cleaning

This section outlines the data cleaning pipeline, including: - Ingestion and standardization of COVID-19 datasets. - Handling missing values and inconsistencies. - Merging datasets to create a unified analysis-ready dataset.

## How to Use This Documentation

-   **Custom Functions**: Refer to the [Custom Functions](funcs.qmd) section for detailed explanations and usage examples of the functions developed for this project.
-   **Data Cleaning**: The [Data Cleaning](data-cleaning.qmd) section provides a step-by-step guide to the data preparation process.
-   **EDA Process**: The [EDA Process](eda.qmd) section walks through the exploratory analysis, including visualizations and key findings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes the following datasets:

-    **COVID-19 Metrics**: Daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

-   **Economic Data**: State-level GDP and per capita income.

-   **Population Data**: State population estimates.

-   **Government Response Data**: Stringency indices and policy metrics. 5. **Vaccination Data**: Daily vaccination counts by state.
